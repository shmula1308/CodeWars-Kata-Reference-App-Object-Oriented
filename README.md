# CodeWars Kata Reference

This is an application that can be used to store solutions of kata challenges from CodeWars. It's a good way to learn programming by keeping notes on how others have solved the same kata.

I used Javascript classes and prism.js, a library that makes it easy to display code by highlighting keywords.
